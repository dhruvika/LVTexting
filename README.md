# So Much Simplicity (SMS)

## Installation on Device

We plan on getting (SMS) onto the Google Play store for easy download and installation, but until then, the only option for installation on a device is by making your device a development device.

To install (SMS) on your android device you must do the following:
- Install Android Studio a compatible computer. Android Studio can be downloaded [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/ "Android Studio")
- Download this repository (SMS) as a ZIP file
- Extract the downloaded ZIP file into a folder
- In Android Studio, go to `File -> New -> Import Project` and import the folder containing the downloaded ZIP file contents. This should open the project in Android Studio
- Follow the instructions [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device "Run apps on a hardware device") to setups your device for development and run the app on your device.

The app must be set as your default SMS app in order access features such as sending deleting messages, so when prompted to do so, tap "Yes". With that, (SMS) should be fully functionaly as your SMS app
