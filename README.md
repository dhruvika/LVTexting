# So Much Simplicity (SMS)

## Installation on Device

We plan on getting (SMS) onto the Google Play store for easy download and installation, but until then, the only option for installation on a device is by making your device a development device.

To install (SMS) on your android device you must do the following:
- Install Android Studio a compatible computer. Android Studio can be downloaded [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/ "Android Studio")
- Download this repository (SMS) as a ZIP file
- Extract the downloaded ZIP file into a folder
- In Android Studio, go to `File -> New -> Import Project` and import the folder containing the downloaded ZIP file contents. This should open the project in Android Studio
- Follow the instructions [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device "Run apps on a hardware device") to setups your device for development and run the app on your device.

The app must be set as your default SMS app in order access features such as sending deleting messages, so when prompted to do so, tap "Yes". With that, (SMS) should be fully functionaly as your SMS app

## How to Use Guide

The app has a couple of different screens that can be accessed and used. They are explained here

### Dashbaord Screen
TODO
Pressing the readaloud button on the top right of the screen will read aloud the names and dates of the different conversations, beginning with unread messages and then continuing to read messages. While the conversations are being read, pressing the GO button will redirect the app to the conversation that is being read at that time.

### Conversation Screen

Pressing the readaloud button on the top right of the screen will read aloud all of the messages that are present on the screen, distinguishing between messages that are sent and received.

Each setting has an "Increase" button on the right and a "Decrease" button on the left, with an up and down facing arrow respectively. These will increase or decrease the relevant setting, changing the apps global settings, as well as the text preview on the screen. Pressing the readaloud button on the top right of the screen will read aloud all of the available settings in order.
